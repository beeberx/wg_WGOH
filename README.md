# Working Group on Oceanic Hydrography

ICES Working Group on Oceanic Hydrography (WGOH) closely monitors the ocean conditions in the ICES area by updating and reviewing results from standard hydrographic sections and stations.

The material presented at the WGOH meetings each year is consolidated and published as the annual ICES Report on Ocean Climate (IROC).

With the IROC, the Working Group analyses multiple time-series in a consistent way to give an overview of the state of the environment in the North Atlantic that includes:

* North Atlantic climate headlines
* Summary of upper ocean conditions
* The North Atlantic Atmosphere
* Detailed area descriptions, part I: the upper Oceans
* Detailed area descriptions, part II: the deep Oceans
* Contact & access information for the time series data

A more detailed annual report from the working group is also compiled that includes all the national reports from the ICES area. The WGOH provide support to other expert groups requiring information on oceanic hydrography as well as expert knowledge and guidance to the ICES Data Centre.
