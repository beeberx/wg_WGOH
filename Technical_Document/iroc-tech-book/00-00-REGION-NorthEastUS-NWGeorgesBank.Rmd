Station Description:,NE US Continental Shelf - Northwest Georges Bank,,,,,
Region:,Northeast US Continental Shelf,,,,,
Latitude:,41.5 N,,,,,
Longitude:,68.3 W,,,,,
Measurement Depth/Range:,1-30 m,,,,,
Long Term Averaging Period:,1991-2020,1991-2020,,,,
Long Term Mean:,10.30,32.58,,,,
Standard Deviation:,0.91,0.27,,,,
Area:,"POLYGON((-69.10 40.70, -67.50 41.50, -67.50 42.20, -68.40 41.70, -69.10 41.00, -69.10 40.70))",,,,,
Spatial Coverage:,Station coverage varies spanning the prescribed polygon 
Vertical Coverage:,Data represents average over 1-30m,,,,,
Temporal Coverage:,Typically 3-6 surveys per year
Seasonal Cycle:,A reference annual cycle is constructed for sub-region by fitting an annual harmonic to the collection of regional mean values from the period 1991-2020. Regional anomalies are calculated as the difference between the regional mean values and this reference annual cycle
Averaging Method:,Regional T and S anomalies are calculated relative to a 1991-2020 seasonal cycle and annually averaged
Notes:,Regional average T/S are are volume-weighted average of observations from single synoptic survey; subsequently averaged annually
