Region:,Northeast US Continental Shelf,,,,,
Latitude:,42.2 N,,,,,
Longitude:,66 W,,,,,
Measurement Depth/Range:,150-200 m,,,,,
Long Term Averaging Period:,1991-2020,1991-2020,,,,

Area:,"POLYGON((-66.80 42.20, -66.00 42.20, -66.00 42.60, -66.80 42.60, -66.80 42.20))",,,,,
Spatial Coverage:,Station coverage varies spanning the prescribed polygon 
Vertical Coverage:,Data represents average over 150-200m,,,,,
Temporal Coverage:,Typically 3-6 surveys per year
Seasonal Cycle:,A reference annual cycle is constructed for sub-region by fitting an annual harmonic to the collection of regional mean values from the period 1991-2020. Regional anomalies are calculated as the difference between the regional mean values and this reference annual cycle
Averaging Method:,Regional T and S anomalies are calculated relative to a 1991-2020 seasonal cycle and annually averaged
Notes:,Regional average T/S are are volume-weighted average of observations from single synoptic survey; subsequently averaged annually
