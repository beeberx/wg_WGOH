Standard Deviation:,1.03,0.33,,,,
Area:,"POLYGON((-68.00 41.80, -67.50 42.10, -67.00 42.10, -66.00 42.10, -66.00 43.00, -66.50 44.20, -67.00 44.20, -68.00 44.20, -68.00 41.80))",,,,,
Spatial Coverage:,Station coverage varies spanning the prescribed polygon 
Vertical Coverage:,Data represents average over 1-30m,,,,,
Temporal Coverage:,Typically 3-6 surveys per year
Seasonal Cycle:,A reference annual cycle is constructed for sub-region by fitting an annual harmonic to the collection of regional mean values from the period 1991-2020. Regional anomalies are calculated as the difference between the regional mean values and this reference annual cycle
Averaging Method:,Regional T and S anomalies are calculated relative to a 1991-2020 seasonal cycle and annually averaged
Notes:,Regional average T/S are are volume-weighted average of observations from single synoptic survey; subsequently averaged annually
